- An automation greenhouse controlled via a microcontroller
- You can take a look at your data with your smartphone(ONLY ANDROID)

# Components:

* Your little greenhouse
* 1 x Microcontroller(I used Elegoo)                            ---To control everything

* 1 x Humidity and Temperature sensor(I used only-in-one)       ---To detect temperature and humidity inside it   
* 1 x A Generic Fan (I used one picked up from an old computer) ---Powered when it has to dehumidify the greenhouse
#### Facoltative Components
* 1 x Electric Pump                                             ---If you wanna automatize watering the plants
* 1 x Photovoltaic Panel                                        ---If you wanna powered the system with it(or any other type of power).                                                       
  ###### Facoltative Components for the Photovoltaic Panel
  * 2 x Step-motor                                              ---To rotate the panel, maybe I'm not gonna use them: I should make a plastic support  (3D print), but this project is already expensive. I am looking for regain something...
  
  
    - Rotate z-axis
    - Rotate xy-axises
  
* 1 x Bluetooth Module HC-05                                    ---To send data
